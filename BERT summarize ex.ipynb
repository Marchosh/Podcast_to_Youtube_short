Christian welcome how we doing good beer. we're doing great and today is gonna be. episode one of a future series on. specific loan products so I asked you. guys to comment on YouTube what you. wanted to hear and you listen and many. of you said we want to have a whole. episode dedicated to one specific loan. product to really dive deep on what it. is sounds to me like a lot of you are. trying to figure out which load you. should be using I'd rather if you had. that conversation with your loan officer. but episodes like this could actually. give you some information to be equipped. with when you go have that conversation. with the lo as we call them in the. industry Today's show is going to be. about the FHA loan Christian let's start. off with describing why we call it FHA. what does that stand for and what does. it mean yeah so it's just the agency. that oversees it it's the federal. housing Administration pretty. straightforward it's a primary residence. only loan so that means you have to live. there this is not something that you can. use to buy an investment property a sec. home your Beach vacation home nothing. like that has to be your primary the. nice thing about it is that it can be a. one to four unit so obviously the most. creative strategy is buying a two three. or four unit that allows you to house. hack to a degree right but you're also. picking up a rental property via a. primary residence loan because part of. the house is rental right when you have. multiple units everybody knows and loves. it as the three and a half percent down. loan right so very minimal down payment. required if there is a downfall about it. there is lifelong mortgage insurance so. that's an extra payment per month not. separate it's included in your mortgage. it never goes away yeah it doesn't go. away when you hit that 80 load of value. doesn't drop off like other loans can. yeah you'd have to actually do a. refinance to get it off and that's. basically the insurance policy that you. pay for the lender because you put so. little money down nice things about it. is that they have the same county loan. limits as conventional loans so you can. go buy up to what your county is. determined to be you know the higher. Value Loan they do have high balance on. limits same as conventional and if you. go higher than the county loan limit. that means that you can no longer use. that product convention no FHA you know. have to go into what we call jumbo loan. so that's what the jumbo loan means 100. yeah you're absolutely right there so. you mentioned FHA stands for the federal. housing Administration my understanding. is this was an illustration that was. created to help make housing affordable. so basically they came in they said hey. we want to make home ownership available. to more Americans what is stopping. people from buying homes well the down. payment you're right let's make it three. and a half percent that's easier than. the five percent the most conventional. loan programs require you to have as a. minimum doubt people well what about the. credit score that's a good point let's. make it less of a credit score that is. needed for someone who's getting. conventional loan so can you just. basically give the difference between uh. the minimum conventional credit score. and the minimum FHA yeah it's it's. significant it's probably a much wider. margin than people think conventional is. usually going to cap out 620 640. a lot. of lenders don't want to see you go. lower than that FHA can go down to 500. and that's like I don't want to say. anybody has bad credit but like 500 is. really not good credit that's several. standard deviations below the average. amount yeah I'll say it that way you're. absolutely right that's that's a Rob. answer right there but yeah that's you. know when you get lower than 600 though. I don't want to say hey you got a 502. credit score FHA loan is going to be a. slam dunk just because something's. possible doesn't mean it's going to be. easy because it could still be more. expensive loan with the lower rates. right or the lower credit score yeah and. there's underwriting criteria that. you're going to have to hurdle through. but yes another issue that stopped. people from being able to buy homes is. if their debt to income ratio wasn't. favorable maybe they had a little bit. too much debt for the income that they. were making so they couldn't buy a home. at all so FHA Loans are more forgiving. there can you share what the standards. are regarding the debts income ratios. this is where FHA really starts to. thrive is that it's very forgiving now. obviously everybody should buy what's in. their means but what's legally possible. of getting you a loan for is a much. higher utilization of your debt to. income ratio than conventional that. typically conventional lending will cap. out in that 42 to 45 percent range. whereas FHA we've got them through as. high as 57 which is more than half of. your grossing which is obviously you got. to be in a specific situation to have. that make sense but just the fact that. it's possible you know will allow some. buying opportunity when otherwise it. wouldn't be there right well that's what. we're here for to help figure out what. loans you can apply for and which ones. are best for you okay tell me more about. FHA Loans now a couple things that I'd. like to note a lot of people say go buy. a home every year FHA loan FHA loan. rinse and repeat right that's not. impossible but there's some obstacles to. overcome number one you can only have. one FHA loan at a time so these are. going to be kind of some myths around. the FHA one you can only have one at a. time that does not mean you can only. have one ever okay so you can buy. refinance it out into another loan. product and then buy again with an FHA. FHA loaned is also not stay I just said. what FHA stands for it does not stand. for first home it is not a first time. home buyers you could use it for your. third fourth fifth Property okay FHA. loan is does not have to be your first. purchase and especially when you get. into buying repeatedly using the FHA. loan you can run into some trouble and. there's two main things to look out when. you move out of a residence and into. another one and when you're using the. FHA loan to qualify for that house. you're moving into there's some rules. and number one is that typically with. loans when you move out you're turning. your old house into a rent this is. getting into the weeds a little bit but. I think it's important people understand. this you're turning your old home into a. rental that means we can credit you with. some of the rental income to help. qualify you for the loan FHA has a. really weird role that unless you move. more than a hundred miles away from that. house you can't use rentaling so while. that doesn't make the move impossible. you have to make enough money to qualify. for both mortgages at the same time if. you don't move 100 miles away which most. people aren't unless they get redeployed. for work or you know repositioned or. something or maybe they're moving family. or going off to school or something so. that's a big one that people a lot of. times Overlook because they think I'm. just gonna buy one house a year and I'm. gonna buy up my whole block and that. gets very difficult to qualify for when. you can't use the rental income from the. houses you're vacating every year number. two probably the the most misunderstood. Rule and then the least well-known one. is the self-sufficiency rule this really. hit us in California when you're buying. a three and four unit property that's it. this doesn't account for a single family. or duplex but when you're buying a three. and four unit the rent events of the. whole property together so let's say. you're buying a fourplex all four units. even though you're occupying one of them. let's say two thousand dollars a unit. times four that's eight grand that money. per month after a 75 haircut so they. would take 25 off and only credit you. with 75 has to be more than your. mortgage and the problem in California. is 75 of 8 000 is whatever six grand to. buy a four Plex you're spending one and. a half two million dollars your payments. are pretty much always gonna be over six. grand so in high cost of living areas. that made three and four unit FHA. purchases almost impossible right people. would have to convert over to the. conventional loan or just put more money. down you know put 15 or 20 down on an. FHA loan which doesn't make sense. another thing people don't think about. you don't have to put three and a half. percent down that's that's all you're. required to but you can bring in more to. make it work 100 yeah so as rates. increase and now monthly payments are. more than the rents it pretty much. invalidated FHA Loans to purchase three. and four unit houses in like the LA's. the New Yorks the Miami's the San. Francisco it still works in small towns. where the rent may be more than the. mortgage but in your big metropolitan. areas it doesn't now you mentioned on. that topic specifically that you have to. take 25 off of the rent so it has to. meet the mortgage and the tax and the. insurance at 75 of rents would that be. the same as saying it has to be to 1.25. dscr ratio math doesn't work out exactly. probably that way but it's very similar. yeah after a 75 haircut it has to be one. yeah why that rule is there I'm not sure. it was probably honestly Fanning man. Freddie Mac trying to limit people using. FHA Loans every single year to buy a. fourplex which is what we've been. telling people to do for the whole time. we've been on the bus yeah that's that's. kind of the anti-bigger pockets rule. right but you know it's a frustrating. one but you can still rock it with you. know single families and adus and. duplexes three and four units have just. become increasingly difficult to do with. an FHA you know Christian you mentioned. that an FHA loan can be used to buy a. three or a four unit property assuming. it meets the self-sufficiency rule which. we talked about that's different than. conventional loads right when you're. buying a three or four unit property. with a conventional loan what's the. minimum down payment three or fours are. going to be 22 unit is going to be 15.. there we go and fhas you could still use. three and a half percent down to buy. these properties correct that's the. massive advantage of FHA Loans not only. will we talk about the credit not only. will we talk about the debt's income. utilization but the fact that the down. payment doesn't change with unit account. technically VA doesn't either but it's. very different than any other product. because it doesn't change the more house. you buy right two three four units are. all the same so what are the issues. people are having right now is what I. refer to as the golden handcuffs dilemma. you bought a property with an FHA loan. you have a killer interest rate 3.25. 3.75 rates are going to be for uh. primary residence probably closer to. seven maybe High sixes right now you. don't want to refi out of your FHA loan. because you're going to get a worse rate. but you can't use the FHA loan to buy. future properties unless you do what. advice do you have for somebody who's. stuck in golden handcuffs but still. wants to scale their portfolio oh easy. right now single family with an Adu five. percent down conventional that's what. I'd say you go to the next best loan. product which is conventional it's five. percent instead of three and a half so. it's a one and a half percent down. payment difference you know depending on. your property size that could be like. three four five thousand dollars right. and you can still get a single family. with opportunity to maybe convert a. garage or an existing Adu you can still. get a pseudo multi-family just remember. those down payments are gonna scale when. you get true multifamils that's true. duplex true Triplex you know now you're. not in that five percent down range. anymore so you go to the next closest. loan product and the next closest asset. class until interest rates settle and. you're able to you know change those. loans on the existing properties and you. can keep those uh those golden handcuffs. on for a little bit and keep those good. rates and do you see a scenario where it. would ever be financially advantageous. to refinance out of a four percent FHA. into a six and a half percent. conventional but then only put three and. a half percent down on a four Plex. that's gonna make you more money in the. future could be absolute and this is I. mean these are analysis that we do with. our borrowers all the time we take a. look at what I call your global cash. flow you know everybody can focus on one. specific property inside cash flow but. what if we refinanced and and lost a. thousand dollars of cash flow from this. property but we gained 1200 on another. one like that's still a 200 gain and if. losing the Thousand opened up the. opportunity to get the 1200 that's still. a win at the end of the day right. because then you can still go refinance. both of them later and drop it back so I. I mean my answer would be yes just look. at it globally does it impact you on a. greater scale than what it's hurting you. losing that rate across your whole. portfolio yeah that's a great point I. mean nobody likes to pay a higher rate. but also nobody likes to be stuck. without being able to scale real estate. so sometimes you have to give something. up to get something and if it's an. expensive property and an FHA loan is. going to save you a lot of money on the. down payment there's a lot of meat on. the bone the rents are going to go up. over time you might see a scenario where. that makes sense we also didn't really. cover the PMI on an FHA loan is called. MIP so a shady loan officer could sort. of say oh no there's no PMI on this loan. they don't tell you that there's. actually MIP can you explain what that. stands for again and what that is one's. upfront and one's monthly so for FHA. loan what a lot of people don't know is. that you do pay your PMI every month. pretty much everybody knows that couple. hundred bucks a month after you purchase. it's added on your marriage up front MIP. usually it's about 1.8 I want to say. percent of the loan amount that is. actually added onto your loan so this is. unique if you ever buy with an FHA loan. look at your total loan amount and look. at your purchase price it won't be. whatever 96.5 which is after your three. and a half percent down payment it'll be. like 98 and that's because they charge. you this one and a half 1.8 Point fee. but they finance it so it's a hidden. cost it's a fee that the letter charges. you to set up your mortgage insurance. and then they finance it so it doesn't. actually hit your pocketbook as as an. expense but in the grand scheme of. things paying down your mortgage it is. because your mortgage is slightly higher. there you go so if you don't know that. MIP can sneak up on you and a loan. officer can tell you there's no PMI and. technically they're right but it's still. deceptive which does happen a lot in. loan industry for being honest there's. lots of ways it's kind of a show game at. times where you can move money from one. place to another luckily if you use us. you don't have to worry about that. remember it can be used for small. multi-family properties the two three. and the four units which is one of the. best reasons to use the FHA loan there. is a self-sufficiency rule so three and. four unit properties must actually cash. flow at a right around 25 percent more. than what the expense is if you want to. use an FHA loan to buy them that's. tougher in high cost of living areas but. in some of the cheaper areas we find. that these loans work much easier so if. you're living in Manhattan or San Diego. it's going to be tough to use an FHA. loan to get yourself a Triplex or a. fourplex but if you're living in. southern states where things are a. little bit more inexpensive or the. Midwest areas this is almost a layup. that you're going to be able to use it. and to round it out you get a more. favorable debt to income ratio credit. score and down payment when you use the. FHA loan so in most cases when someone. comes to us with the one brokerage and. says I want to buy a primary residence I. want a house act what can I do we start. with the FHA low if you don't already. have one that's usually what we do and. if you do have one then we say well. here's a conventional option or do you. want to refinance out of the FHA and use. that to buy so Christian what advice do. you have for people that are going to. approach their loan officer with this. Vegas is that if you're not hearing this. advice probably talking to the wrong guy. you need to talk to somebody who's. knowledgeable bread products don't talk. to a loan officer that just offers one. product it's the biggest mistake people. make I go to Chase and I get a Chase. loan okay that's not shade at Chase. that's just a single bank that offers a. single luck right go somewhere that. knows different products that can help. you pick the one that's right for you. and can help you get in the property. where you otherwise wouldn't be able to. otherwise right Christian thank you so. much for your time and sharing your. knowledge regarding FHA Loans I feel. smarter I'm sure a lot of our audience. does as well where can people reach out. to find more about you and connect with. you yep anywhere online I'm on social. media the one broker do you want to. direct email me Christian. theonbrokers.com that's also our website. the onedbrokers.com and you can go to. davidgreen24.com where I have a chat. option that I am actually monitoring. myself right now there is like an AI. auto response but I still see the. message and I will reply back once I see. it so go check that out let me know what. you're looking to do and I'll get you. connected with anyone that I know that. can help you and as a last request can. you just go to the comment section and. tell us what you thought of today's. video did you learn anything you didn't. know is this helpful are we at Bigger. Pockets helping you to make money in. real estate and are you happy that Chris. and I are here and we also would like to. know what loan product do you want to. learn more about next so if you go to. the show description you can find a link. to take a poll to vote for what is the. next loan product that you'd like us to. break down and explain in more detail. equipping you to move forward and make. money with real estate if you've got. some time check out another Bigger.
